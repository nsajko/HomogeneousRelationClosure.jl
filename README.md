A software package for the Julia programming language implementing *closure* and *reduction* operators for some properties of homogeneous binary relations, such as *reflexivity*, *symmetry* or *transitivity*.

Each homogeneous binary relation is assumed to be represented by a (square, logical) adjacency matrix (`AbstractMatrix`), whose elements support multiplication/conjunction (`*`), addition/disjunction (`+`) and negation (`!`). The element type is intended to be a Boolean algebra, such as provided by the package [TwoElementBooleanAlgebra.jl](https://github.com/nsajko/TwoElementBooleanAlgebra.jl). A fuzzy logic implementing the same operations should also work, in place of a Boolean logic (no idea if there's any application for that). Optionally, it is also possible to provide the scalar operations explicitly.

## Functionality

* reflexivity

    * *reflexive closure*

        * The smallest reflexive relation that includes the input relation.

        * Unique.

        * `homogeneous_relation_reflexive_closure!(::AbstractMatrix)`

    * *reflexive reduction*

        * The smallest relation included by the input relation that has the same reflexive closure as the input relation.

        * Unique.

        * `homogeneous_relation_reflexive_reduction!(::AbstractMatrix)`

* symmetry

    * *symmetric closure*

        * The smallest symmetric relation that includes the input relation.

        * Unique.

        * `homogeneous_relation_symmetric_closure!(::AbstractMatrix)`

    * *symmetric reduction*

        * Smallest relation included by the input relation that has the same symmetric closure as the input relation.

        * Not unique.

        * `homogeneous_relation_symmetric_reduction!(::AbstractMatrix)`

* transitivity

    * *transitive closure*

        * The smallest transitive relation that includes the input relation.

        * Unique.

        * `homogeneous_relation_transitive_closure!(::AbstractMatrix)`

    * *transitive reduction*

        * Smallest relation included by the input relation that has the same transitive closure as the input relation.

        * Not unique, except for directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).

        * `homogeneous_relation_transitive_reduction_of_acyclic!(::AbstractMatrix)`: warning: silently produces incorrect results in the presence of cycles
